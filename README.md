# mobile-robotics-victim-localization-tracking-aerial-view

In this project i have simulated the paper: "Camera based mapping in SAR via flying and ground robots (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-024-01594-4)

The 3 core stages are:
  1- Victim Detection using YOLO8n
  2- Victim Localization using opencv
  3- Victim Tracking using a Kalman Filter

Here is the link the video explaining the code: https://youtu.be/Zv_d28XeWFc?si=4-9ERZR77axTCBW7
